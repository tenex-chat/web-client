# Medium Risk: Test Failures Report

## Issue Severity: Medium

## Summary
Multiple unit tests are failing due to mock setup issues and changes in component implementations. These failures don't affect the production build but should be addressed to maintain test coverage and code quality.

## Test Failures Identified

### 1. NDKProject Tests (3 failures)
- **File**: `src/lib/ndk-events/NDKProject.test.ts`
- **Issues**:
  - `Repository Support > should handle repository tag`: Test expects a different tag structure
  - `Event Conversion > should convert to event with all properties`: Missing image tag in conversion
  - `Static Methods > should create from event`: Mock setup issue with `rawEvent()` function

### 2. NDKAgentDefinition Tests (2 failures)
- **File**: `src/lib/ndk-events/NDKAgentDefinition.test.ts`
- **Issues**:
  - `should set and get name`: Property accessor issue with mock
  - `should create from raw event`: Skipped due to mock setup complexity

### 3. Button Component Tests (1 failure)
- **File**: `src/components/ui/button.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Size class mismatch - expects `h-10` but receives `h-9`

### 4. ProjectAvatar Tests (2 failures)
- **File**: `src/components/ui/project-avatar.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Initials generation test failing - expects different text content

## Impact Assessment
- **Production Impact**: None - all test failures are related to test setup and mocking
- **Development Impact**: Medium - reduces confidence in test suite and makes refactoring riskier
- **CI/CD Impact**: May cause automated test pipelines to fail

## Recommended Actions

### Short-term (Low Risk)
1. Skip or disable failing tests temporarily with clear TODO comments
2. Update test expectations to match current implementation for simple cases (like button size)

### Medium-term (Medium Risk)
1. Refactor mock setup to properly simulate NDK event structures
2. Update test assertions to match the current component implementations
3. Consider using testing utilities like `@testing-library/react` more effectively

### Long-term (Higher Risk)
1. Implement integration tests that don't rely heavily on mocks
2. Consider using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for more realistic API mocking
3. Establish a testing strategy that balances unit and integration tests

## Technical Details

The main issue stems from the mocking of NDK (Nostr Development Kit) events. The test mocks don't fully implement the expected interface, particularly:
- Missing `rawEvent()` method implementation
- Incomplete tag structure simulation
- Property accessors not properly mocked

## Conclusion
These test failures are technical debt that should be addressed, but they don't represent critical bugs in the application. The issues are primarily related to test infrastructure and mock setup rather than actual functionality problems.

## Priority: Medium
While not critical for production, fixing these tests will improve development velocity and reduce the risk of introducing regressions in future changes.
