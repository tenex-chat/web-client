OpenAI's Realtime API is designed for real-time conversational AI applications that handle bidirectional audio streaming, voice activity detection (VAD), conversation and turn management, function calling, and fine-grained session control. It differs from traditional speech-to-text APIs by integrating conversation state, low-latency streaming both ways (speech-to-speech), and function calling in a single WebRTC or WebSocket-based interface.

**WebRTC Audio Streaming**:  
The API supports WebRTC, establishing a peer-to-peer connection between client and server that facilitates efficient real-time audio streaming with low latency. WebRTC handles much of the media transport automatically (audio capture, encoding, decoding, jitter buffering), enabling smooth bidirectional speech-to-speech interaction. Alternatively, audio can be streamed via WebSocket as base64-encoded chunks if WebRTC is not used, but this requires manual buffer management and has higher serialization overhead[3][5].

**Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**:  
The API includes built-in VAD functionality to detect when a user starts and stops speaking. This can operate server-side to automatically decide when to commit segments of speech for transcription or trigger turn transitions in conversations. VAD dramatically improves session flow by signaling when the user’s input is complete and the AI should respond without explicit client intervention, enabling seamless conversational turns[2][4].

**Server-Sent Events and Conversation Management**:  
The Realtime API operates over a long-lived WebSocket or WebRTC connection exchanging JSON-formatted events. These include 9 client event types and 28 server event types, covering audio streaming, state updates, transcript delivery, and turn detection. A conversation is maintained as a stateful object on the server, aggregating user audio inputs and AI-generated responses (both audio and text), facilitating context continuity and intermediate streaming responses token-by-token[1][3][5].

**Turn Detection**:  
Phrase or turn detection is integral to managing multi-turn conversations. The API leverages VAD and internal heuristics to detect when the user stops talking and expects the AI’s response, enabling natural dialog flows. This replaces the need for explicit end-of-utterance signals common in traditional speech APIs and supports overlapped speech where either party may interrupt[2][3].

**Function Calling Capabilities**:  
The Realtime API can invoke external functions dynamically during conversations, allowing integration with application logic or data retrieval. This means beyond plain transcription and language generation, it can perform structured interactions, e.g., fetch information, trigger actions, or update contexts, all inline with the conversational flow. This extends API utility beyond classic speech-to-text or TTS systems[5].

**Differences from Traditional Speech-to-Text APIs**:  
- **Bidirectional, low-latency speech-to-speech** streaming versus one-way transcription.  
- **Integrated conversation state management**, where multiple audio/text turns compose a continuous session.  
- **Built-in VAD and turn detection** to enable smooth conversational interaction without manual signaling.  
- **Function calling embedded during interactions**, allowing dynamic and context-aware extension of AI capabilities.  
- **Streaming token responses and audio output** for real-time UI updates, compared to batch post-processing in most traditional APIs.  
- Supports WebRTC for optimal media path and real-time interactivity, whereas traditional APIs primarily rely on HTTP/WebSocket but do not integrate this tightly[1][2][3][5].

In summary, OpenAI’s Realtime API offers an advanced conversational AI infrastructure combining real-time bidirectional audio streaming via WebRTC, sophisticated session and turn management enabled by VAD and server events, with powerful function calling embedded. This makes it distinct from standard speech-to-text APIs by providing a fully interactive, streaming, conversation-aware, and extensible AI voice interface platform.
