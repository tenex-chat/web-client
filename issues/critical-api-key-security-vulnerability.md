# CRITICAL: API Key Security Vulnerability

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Issue Description

API keys are being exposed and stored insecurely in the client-side application, creating severe security vulnerabilities.

### 1. Direct API Key Exposure in Frontend Bundle

**Location**: 
- `src/hooks/useSpeechToText.ts`
- `src/hooks/useLLM.ts`

**Problem**: OpenAI API key accessed via `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is exposed in the client-side JavaScript bundle. Anyone can extract this key from the website's source code.

### 2. Client-Side Storage of API Keys

**Location**:
- `src/stores/llmConfig.ts`
- `src/stores/llm.ts`
- `src/services/murfTTS.ts`

**Problem**: API keys (Murf.ai, LLM providers) are stored unencrypted in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Impact

- Unauthorized API usage leading to unexpected billing
- Complete compromise of third-party service accounts
- Potential data theft or abuse of API capabilities
- Reputational damage

## Recommended Solution

### Immediate Mitigation
1. Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
2. Remove all API keys from environment variables prefixed with `VITE_`
3. Clear any API keys stored in localStorage

### Long-term Solution
Implement a backend proxy service that:
1. Stores API keys securely server-side
2. Provides authenticated endpoints for API calls
3. Implements rate limiting and usage monitoring
4. Never exposes API keys to the client

## Risk Level
This vulnerability allows anyone to steal and abuse API keys, potentially resulting in significant financial loss and service abuse. This must be addressed before any production deployment.
