  - **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive UI with iOS/Android optimizations

  ## Key Technical Context
  - **Protocol**: Built on Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays)
  - **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
  - **State Management**: Jotai for local state, NDK for Nostr data
  - **UI Components**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui component system
  - **Key Libraries**: @nostr-dev-kit/ndk-hooks, Lucide React icons
  - **Authentication**: Nostr key-based (nsec/npub) with NIP-07 browser extension support
