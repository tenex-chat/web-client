I found the major issues causing the poor appearance and serif font problem:

## Critical Issues to Fix:

### 1. **Font Configuration Missing**
The Tailwind config is missing font family configuration. We need to add proper sans-serif fonts.

### 2. **App.css Conflicts** 
The App.css has conflicting styles that interfere with our design:
- `#root` has `max-width: 1280px` and `margin: 0 auto` which centers and constrains the layout
- `padding: 2rem` adds unwanted padding
- `text-align: center` centers all text

### 3. **Tailwind Config Too Basic**
The tailwind.config.js is missing essential configurations for fonts, colors, and other design tokens.

## Required Fixes:

1. **Update tailwind.config.js** to include:
   - Font family configuration with proper sans-serif fonts
   - Extended color palette
   - Proper theme configuration

2. **Fix App.css** to remove conflicting styles that interfere with our Telegram-like design

3. **Update index.html** to include Google Fonts for better typography

4. **Test the interface** in browser to verify the fixes work

Please implement these fixes immediately and then test the interface to ensure it looks professional and uses proper fonts.

The current serif font issue is making the entire interface look unprofessional despite the good component design.
