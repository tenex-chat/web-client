# Hashtag Events List Component Verification

**Status:** **FAILURE** - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')` persists.

**Date of Verification:** 2025-09-14

**Verified by:** `web-tester` (`npub1pc587f8azl4vhaddms83u94j7e32uwjx8f932mdw0gw9nhzlpwhsjvxsum`)

**Environment:**
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/projects`
*   **TENEX Web (Local Development)**

**Test Steps:**

1.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/projects`.
2.  Wait for approximately 2 seconds for initial page content to load. (This helps ensure projects are loaded, and the sidebar is populated).
3.  Click on the "TENEX web" project button in the left sidebar. (This action opens the corresponding project column on the right side of the screen).
4.  Within the newly opened "TENEX web" project column, locate and click the "hashtag icon" button. (This button is typically found near the project title, alongside other action buttons).

**Expected Behavior:**

The `HashtagEventsList` component should render without any JavaScript errors in the browser console. The virtualized list should display filtered hashtag events related to the "TENEX web" project.

**Actual Behavior (Errors Observed):**

Immediately upon clicking the "hashtag icon" button (in step 4), the following critical JavaScript errors and warnings appear in the browser console:

*   **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')`**
    *   This confirms the user's initial report that the error is still present.
    *   The error stack trace points to `HashtagEventsList` and `virtual-list.tsx`, indicating a problem with `useRef` usage within this component or its virtualized list dependency.

*   **`react-dom.development.js:27598 The above error occurred in the <HashtagEventsList> component:`**
    *   Explicitly reports the error origin within the `HashtagEventsList` component.

*   **`react-dom.development.js:27598 Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.`**
    *   This warning is a strong indicator of improper React hook usage, where `useRef` (or another hook) is likely being called outside the rules of hooks (e.g., inside a conditional, a loop, or a non-function component).

**Evidence:**

*   Browser console logs captured after step 4, showing the `TypeError` and `Invalid hook call` messages.

**Conclusion & Recommendation:**

The `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')` remains unresolved. The issue manifests specifically when attempting to activate the `HashtagEventsList` component via its UI button. The "Invalid hook call" warning indicates a fundamental problem with how React hooks are implemented in `HashtagEventsList` or its virtualized list sub-component.

Further investigation into the `HashtagEventsList` component's code, particularly its use of `useRef` and its interaction with `virtual-list.tsx`, is required. Developers should examine the component's lifecycle and hook usage to ensure strict adherence to React's Rules of Hooks.

**Changelog:**
- 2025-09-14: Re-verified the persistence of `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')` with precise steps, confirming the error is still reproducible after clicking the hashtag icon within a project column.
