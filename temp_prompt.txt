Fix mobile app layout issues with safe area handling:

CONTEXT: This is a React Native or mobile web app with a tab bar navigation at the bottom. The current layout has two critical issues:
1. The bottom tab bar is not respecting the device's safe area (home indicator area on iOS)
2. The "Create Project" button is positioned too low and gets hidden behind the tab bar

SPECIFIC TASKS TO COMPLETE:
1. First, search the codebase to understand the current tab bar implementation and layout structure
2. Identify the components responsible for:
   - The bottom tab bar navigation
   - The "Create Project" button positioning
   - Any existing safe area handling
3. Fix the tab bar to properly respect safe area insets (add padding-bottom for iOS home indicator)
4. Adjust the "Create Project" button positioning so it's not hidden by the tab bar
5. Ensure the main content area has proper bottom padding to account for the tab bar height

SCOPE: Only fix the safe area and positioning issues shown in the screenshot. Do not modify other functionality or add new features.

COMPLETION: Use attempt_completion with a summary of what layout changes were made and which files were modified.
