# Long Press Feature Test Guide

## Feature Implementation Summary
âœ… **Implemented long-press functionality for the '+' button in the project column**

### Changes Made:
1. **Added long-press detection** to the '+' button in the conversations tab
2. **Created dropdown menu** that appears on long-press with two options:
   - ðŸ“± New Conversation
   - ðŸ“ž New Voice Call
3. **Preserved existing functionality** - regular click still creates new conversation

### How to Test:

#### Desktop (Mouse):
1. Navigate to a project column
2. Select the "Conversations" tab
3. **Short Click** on '+' button â†’ Should create a new conversation (existing behavior)
4. **Long Press** (hold for 500ms) on '+' button â†’ Should show dropdown with two options:
   - "New Conversation" with message icon
   - "New Voice Call" with phone icon
5. Click either option to trigger the respective action

#### Mobile/Touch Devices:
1. Same as above but using touch gestures
2. **Tap** for new conversation
3. **Long Press** for dropdown menu

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses `setTimeout` with 500ms delay for long-press detection
- Handles both mouse and touch events
- Cleans up timers on component unmount to prevent memory leaks
- Dropdown only appears for "conversations" tab (other tabs maintain original behavior)
- Voice call triggers the existing `CallView` component

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/layout/ProjectColumn.tsx`
  - Added imports for `useRef`, `Phone` icon, and dropdown components
  - Added state for dropdown visibility
  - Implemented long-press detection logic
  - Created event handlers for mouse/touch events
  - Added dropdown menu with two options

### Test Scenarios:
1. âœ… Short click â†’ New conversation
2. âœ… Long press (500ms) â†’ Dropdown appears
3. âœ… Select "New Conversation" â†’ Creates new conversation
4. âœ… Select "New Voice Call" â†’ Opens CallView
5. âœ… Mouse leave during long press â†’ Cancels dropdown
6. âœ… Other tabs (Docs, Agents) â†’ Original '+' button behavior unchanged

### Notes:
- The voice call functionality uses the existing `CallView` component
- The dropdown uses the existing UI components from the design system
- Touch and mouse events are both supported for cross-platform compatibility
