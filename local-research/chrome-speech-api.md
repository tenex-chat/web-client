Querying perplexity using sonar for: Chrome Web Speech API SpeechRecognition real-time transcription implementation guide 2024 with maxTokens: 21000
To implement **real-time transcription using Chrome's Web Speech API `SpeechRecognition` in 2024**, you create an instance of `SpeechRecognition` (or `webkitSpeechRecognition` for Chrome), configure it for continuous and interim results, and handle the `onresult` event to update the transcript as the user speaks. This allows you to display live, incremental transcription on a webpage.

Here is a practical step-by-step outline with key code snippets based on the latest usage patterns:

1. **Check browser support**  
   Use:
   ```js
   const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
   if (!SpeechRecognition) {
     alert("Your browser does not support SpeechRecognition.");
   }
   ```

2. **Create a recognition instance**  
   ```js
   const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
   recognition.lang = 'en-US';                      // Set language
   recognition.interimResults = true;                // Enable intermediate results for real-time updates
   recognition.continuous = true;                    // Keep recognition running continuously
   ```

3. **Handle real-time transcription**  
   Listen for the `onresult` event, which fires every time new speech is recognized (interim or final):  
   ```js
   recognition.onresult = (event) => {
     let transcript = '';
     for (let i = event.resultIndex; i < event.results.length; i++) {
       transcript += event.results[i][0].transcript;
     }
     document.getElementById('transcription-result').textContent = transcript;
   };
   ```

4. **Start and stop recognition**  
   Attach start/stop controls to a button:  
   ```js
   const button = document.getElementById('recording-button');
   let recognizing = false;

   button.onclick = () => {
     if (recognizing) {
       recognition.stop();
       button.textContent = 'Start recording';
     } else {
       recognition.start();
       button.textContent = 'Stop recording';
     }
     recognizing = !recognizing;
   };
   ```

5. **Handle errors and end events**  
   ```js
   recognition.onerror = (event) => console.error('Speech Recognition Error', event.error);
   recognition.onend = () => {
     // Optionally restart recognition if continuous operation is desired
     if (recognizing) recognition.start();
   };
   ```

6. **HTML skeleton**  
   A minimal page with a button and a div to show the transcript:  
   ```html
   <button id="recording-button">Start recording</button>
   <div id="transcription-result"></div>
   ```

This approach results in a **live transcription experience** that updates as the user speaks, showing partial results immediately and refining them until finalized.

### Additional context and tips for 2024

- Chrome typically prefixes the API as `webkitSpeechRecognition`, but using the above fallback ensures compatibility.
- `interimResults` enabled gives a real-time feel but may include inaccuracies which are refined as speech finalizes.
- Continuous mode (`continuous = true`) keeps recognition active until explicitly stopped.
- The API is still server-based in Chrome (audio sent to Google servers), so **offline recognition is not yet natively supported**, though improvements for offline mode are under discussion for future releases[3][5].
- For React or modern frameworks, encapsulate this logic in a component with proper lifecycle management to start and stop the service cleanly[2].
- The Web Speech API is currently an experimental technology; full support and stability differ across browsers, and it’s best suited for Chrome desktop/mobile.
