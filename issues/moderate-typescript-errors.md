## Impact
- Build failure prevents deployment
- Type safety violations could lead to runtime errors
- May affect application stability

## Recommended Actions
1. Fix import statements to properly import values vs types
2. Update type definitions to match actual usage
3. Add proper null checks for optional properties
4. Ensure interface definitions are complete
5. Run TypeScript compiler in strict mode after fixes

## Risk Level
Moderate - These errors prevent compilation but fixing them requires careful analysis to ensure no functional regressions are introduced.
