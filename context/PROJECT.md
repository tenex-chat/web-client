## Project: TENEX Web
TENEX Web is a robust, decentralised web application designed to enable secure, efficient, and direct interactions between users and AI agents within the Nostr ecosystem. It aims to provide users with collaborative capabilities for managing projects, delegating tasks, and leveraging AI assistance seamlessly.

### Core Functionality and Features
The application offers a suite of tools for:
* **Agent Management:** Defined through modular components, enabling the deployment and interaction with various AI agents. New enhancements make agent definitions adaptable and intuitive to manage.
* **Project Coordination:** Centralization of project information, tasks, and communications. Recent improvements include visual indicators for project status, enhancing user visibility for active tasks.
* **Secure Communication:** All interactions are maintained via the Nostr protocol, ensuring privacy and censorship resistance, with comprehensive logging of actions for transparency.
* **Code Execution and Management:** Supports dynamic code execution within the system, facilitating interactions with features powered by AI tools. Error handling and state management have been improved based on user interactions.
* **Data Integrity and Persistence:** Management of project data is based on the NDK model, ensuring updates and deletions remain aligned with event handling protocols.

### Key Components and Concepts
* **Nostr Protocol:** Central to all communication, this protocol maintains the secure and decentralized nature of interactions within TENEX Web.
* **AI Agents:** Represented as autonomous entities that assist users across various tasks, with recent optimizations for learning from user behavior, enhancing interaction quality.
* **Workflows and Phases:** Structured processes managed through high-level components allowing multi-step tasks and agent interactions, dynamically adapted based on user feedback.
* **Immutable Events:** Designed to maintain a verifiable log of actions, these events ensure reliable communication and data integrity across the platform.

### User Flows
#### Project Creation and Management
Users can initiate new projects, define their scope, and invite participants while receiving guided assistance from AI agents during setup. Enhanced visibility on task timelines has improved flow management.

#### Agent Definition and Deployment
Users and project managers define new AI agents with designated roles and functionalities. Improvements in user interface design have made this process more user-friendly and efficient.

#### Task Delegation and Execution
Tasks can be delegated to specific AI agents or groups, with improved tracking of execution performance and outcome feedback, enhancing overall task management.

#### Secure Communication and Collaboration
All user interactions—including messaging and updates—are logged through Nostr events, strengthening secure collaboration within the project.

#### Data Persistence and Updates
Project and agent data management leverages Nostr's replaceable events, ensuring persistence while allowing dynamic updates based on user needs.
