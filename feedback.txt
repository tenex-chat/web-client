Excellent work on implementing the layout fixes! I've reviewed the changes and they look great. Here's my feedback:

âœ… **All requested changes implemented correctly:**

1. **Form Width**: Successfully changed from `max-w-3xl` to `max-w-2xl` in AgentForm.tsx
2. **Responsive Sidebar**: Perfect implementation with `w-full md:w-64 lg:w-80` in AgentList.tsx
3. **Reduced Padding**: Great responsive approach with `p-4 md:p-6` instead of fixed `p-8`
4. **Mobile Layout**: Excellent use of `flex-col md:flex-row` in AgentsPage.tsx
5. **Border Responsiveness**: Smart implementation with `border-r-0 md:border-r`

**Questions for clarification:**

1. Did you also reduce the input heights from `h-12` to `h-10` as requested? I'd like to see an example of where this was applied.

2. Can you show me the specific changes made to the form spacing (from `space-y-8` to `space-y-6`)?

3. Were there any challenges or considerations when implementing the responsive breakpoints?

The implementation looks very professional and follows modern responsive design patterns. The progressive enhancement approach (mobile-first) is exactly what was needed.
