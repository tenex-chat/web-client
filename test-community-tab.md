# Community Tab Implementation Test

## What was implemented

Added a new "Community" tab to the project column that shows a unified feed of all public activity within a project.

## Features

1. **Unified Feed**: Displays all project-related events in one chronological stream:
   - Conversations (kind 24133)
   - Documents (kind 30023) 
   - Hashtag-related posts (kind 1)

2. **Event Display**: Each event shows:
   - Author avatar and name
   - Event type icon (MessageSquare, FileText, or Hash)
   - Event type label
   - Relative timestamp
   - Content preview (truncated to 100 chars)
   - Associated hashtags (max 3 displayed)

3. **Event Handling**: Clicking events triggers appropriate actions:
   - Conversations open in the chat interface
   - Documents open in the document viewer
   - Hashtag posts open in the event modal

4. **Empty States**: Appropriate messaging when:
   - No community activity exists yet
   - Waiting for events to load

## Testing Steps

1. Navigate to a project in the UI
2. Click on the "Community" tab (Users icon) in the project column
3. Verify the tab displays properly
4. Check that events are loading and displaying correctly
5. Test clicking on different event types to ensure proper navigation

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/layout/tab-contents/CommunityContent.tsx` - New component for Community tab content
- `/src/components/layout/tab-contents/index.tsx` - Added CommunityContent export
- `/src/components/layout/ProjectColumn.tsx` - Added Community tab to tabs list and content mapping

## Implementation Details

The Community tab uses the existing NDK subscription hooks to fetch:
- Conversation roots filtered by project dTag
- Documents filtered by project dTag 
- Hashtag events filtered by project hashtags

Events are combined, sorted by creation time (newest first), and displayed in a unified scrollable list using the existing UI components and patterns from the codebase.
