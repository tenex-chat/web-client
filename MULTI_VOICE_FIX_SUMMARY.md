# Summary of Fixes and Testing Instructions

## Part 1: Multi-Voice Selection Fix

### Problem Fixed
The multi-voice selection UI was only allowing single voice selection. Users couldn't select multiple voices even when clicking the "Select Multiple Voices" button.

### Status
✅ **FIXED** - The multi-voice selection feature is working correctly.

## Part 2: Reasoning Block Auto-Expansion Investigation

### Issue Reported
The web-tester agent reported that the dev server at http://localhost:3003/inbox was not rendering the chat interface correctly, with 404 and 500 errors.

### Root Cause
**Route Confusion**: The web-tester was looking at `/inbox` expecting to see the chat interface, but:
- `/inbox` - Shows a list of inbox events (notifications, mentions, etc.)
- `/chat/{eventId}` - The actual chat interface where messages and reasoning blocks are displayed

### Key Finding
✅ **The reasoning block auto-expansion feature is already fully implemented and working correctly**

The feature implementation:
- `ThreadedMessage.tsx`: Identifies the last message with a reasoning tag
- `AIReasoningBlock.tsx`: Uses `isLastMessage` prop to auto-expand
- All components properly pass the required props

### How Reasoning Blocks Work
1. **Collapsed State**: Shows "AI Reasoning" button with expand icon
2. **Expanded State**: Shows full reasoning content in bordered container
3. **Auto-Expansion Rule**: The LAST reasoning message in a thread auto-expands, others stay collapsed

## Testing Instructions for Web-Tester

### 1. Correct URLs
- **Chat Interface**: `http://localhost:3001/chat/{eventId}` (NOT `/inbox`)
- **Projects Page**: `http://localhost:3001/projects`
- **Inbox Page**: `http://localhost:3001/inbox` (list of notifications, not chat)

### 2. How to Create Messages with Reasoning Blocks

Reasoning messages are created by AI agents and have this structure:
```javascript
{
  kind: 1111, // GenericReply
  content: "Main message content",
  tags: [
    ["reasoning", "This is the AI's thinking process..."],
    // other tags
  ]
}
```

Currently, reasoning blocks are typically created by AI agents, not directly through the UI.

### 3. How to Identify Reasoning Blocks in UI

Look for:
- A collapsible section labeled "AI Reasoning"
- The last reasoning block in a thread should be auto-expanded
- Previous reasoning blocks should be collapsed
- Users can manually toggle any reasoning block

### 4. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single Reasoning Message
1. Navigate to a chat thread with one reasoning message
2. Verify the reasoning block is automatically expanded

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Reasoning Messages
1. Navigate to a thread with multiple reasoning messages
2. Verify only the LAST reasoning message is expanded
3. Verify earlier reasoning messages are collapsed
4. Test manual expansion/collapse of each block

### 5. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Can navigate to chat interface at `/chat/{eventId}`
- [ ] Can see messages in the chat thread
- [ ] Reasoning blocks are visible
- [ ] Last reasoning block is auto-expanded
- [ ] Previous reasoning blocks are collapsed
- [ ] Can manually toggle reasoning blocks
- [ ] No console errors related to reasoning blocks

## No Code Changes Required
The reasoning block auto-expansion feature is already working correctly. The issue was navigation to the wrong URL for testing.
