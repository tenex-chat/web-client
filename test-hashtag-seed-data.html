                <p>To test hashtags properly, you need to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start a new conversation in the app</li>
                    <li>The conversation needs to be created with t-tags</li>
                    <li>Currently, only brainstorm mode adds hashtags automatically</li>
                    <li>Or you can manually add hashtags when creating threads</li>
