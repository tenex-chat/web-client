TASK: Fix layout issues on the /agents page based on debug investigation findings

CONTEXT: A debug investigation has identified specific layout problems on the /agents page. The main issues are:
1. **Disproportionate Form Width**: AgentForm uses `max-w-3xl` (768px) creating unbalanced layout vs 320px sidebar
2. **Fixed Sidebar Width**: AgentList uses rigid `w-80` (320px) without responsive considerations
3. **Excessive Padding**: Form container uses `p-8` with large spacing on elements
4. **Oversized Form Elements**: Input fields use `h-12` making them too large
5. **Missing Responsive Design**: No breakpoints for mobile/tablet optimization

SPECIFIC FILES TO MODIFY:
- src/components/agents/AgentList.tsx - Fixed width sidebar
- src/components/agents/AgentForm.tsx - Form width and spacing
- src/components/agents/AgentMainContent.tsx - Content area
- src/components/AgentsPage.tsx - Main layout container

SCOPE: You should implement the following fixes:
1. Reduce form max-width from `max-w-3xl` to `max-w-2xl` for better proportions
2. Implement responsive sidebar width (e.g., `w-64 lg:w-80`)
3. Reduce form padding from `p-8` to `p-6` and input heights from `h-12` to `h-10`
4. Add responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet views
5. Optimize flex space distribution between sidebar and content area

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Only modify the layout and styling issues identified in the debug report
- Focus on improving proportions, spacing, and responsive design
- Test that the changes maintain functionality while improving visual balance
- Do not add new features or change functionality beyond layout fixes
- Signal completion using attempt_completion with a summary of the specific changes made

These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.
